# SSH-BANDIT-STD22082

**_

1. ..IN THE FIRST TITLE YOU WILL SEE THE LINES THAT LOOK LIKE YOUR TERMINAL

2. ..IN THE SECOND YOU WILL SEE THE COMMANDS THAT YOU HAVE TO WRITE ON EACH STEP 
YOU CAN JUST COPY AND PASTE THEM AND YOU WILL SEE BY YOURSELF THAT IT ABSOLUTELY WORKS
 
3. ..IN THE THIRD TITLE YOU WILL SEE THE PASSWORD TO ACCESS THE NEXT LEVEL

### Note ::: this game is in a site called OVERTHEWIRE (bandit), you will see the instructions in that site, but this is the solution for levels 0->22, and you do all these answers in your own terminal

Good luck to you !
